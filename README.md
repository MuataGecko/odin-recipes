# odin-recipes

This is the first project in the online learning tool The Odin Project.
This project is going to be a basic recipe website that helps me to
learn the basics of HTML and how to incorporate knowledge learned into
a useful webpage. It will also serve as a basis for continued learning
later on during the course.
